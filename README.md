# omniplugin

**The playbook for omni-platform agent plugins — one repo, one core, native installs on every agentic platform.**

Agentic platforms are multiplying — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, and next quarter's three new ones — and each has its own plugin format, discovery model, hook events, and marketplace. The naive answer is a port per platform, which turns every bug fix into N pull requests. The answer that works is the **omni-repo**: one repository whose portable core (Agent-Skills-standard `skills/` + a zero-dependency CLI engine + one state home) is shared verbatim, wrapped in the thinnest possible per-platform glue.

This playbook is that pattern, extracted from a plugin that actually shipped it: [**engram**](https://github.com/nagisanzenin/engram) runs natively on **Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, Google Antigravity, and OpenClaw** — same skills, same engine, same user state, on all six. The sixth is a chat gateway rather than a coding tool, which is the case that proved the pattern generalises past the terminal. Every rule in here carries a receipt: the real bug, review round, or user report that taught it. No rules without receipts.

## The doctrine, in ten lines

1. **One portable core, thin glue.** Skills + a deterministic CLI engine, shared byte-identical; platforms get manifests and adapters, never forks.
2. **The shell is the only universal ABI.** The engine is a stdlib-only CLI — every platform can shell out; almost none share a plugin API.
3. **Skills are the portable unit.** Agent Skills `SKILL.md` is the closest thing to a cross-platform standard; write behavior there, once.
4. **One state home.** Learn/work in one tool, continue in another — that's what makes it *omni* rather than N parallel installs.
5. **Resolve roots by waterfall, then landmark.** Env vars where platforms set them; the directory containing your manifest where they don't.
6. **Hooks degrade to silence,** self-resolve, fail closed, and always `exit 0`. An ambient feature must never break a session.
7. **Preserve invariants, not mechanisms.** Your guarantees survive porting; the mechanism enforcing them won't. Map one to the other per platform.
8. **Research loaders, never port by analogy.** Schema, CLI changelog, flagship plugin — before one line of glue.
9. **Check every root path against every platform.** Namespaces overlap; a file added for platform N can change behavior on platform M.
10. **Verified-live or say so.** Every platform doc carries Verified / Not-verified, item by item, forever.

## Install it — yes, as a plugin

A playbook about omni-platform plugins had better be one. The repo ships [`skills/omniplugin/SKILL.md`](skills/omniplugin/SKILL.md): install it and your agent consults the playbook on its own whenever multi-platform plugin work comes up (creating, porting, reviewing a port PR, releasing).

| Platform | Install |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `claude plugin marketplace add nagisanzenin/omniplugin` then `claude plugin install omniplugin@omniplugin` |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `codex plugin marketplace add nagisanzenin/omniplugin` then `codex plugin add omniplugin@omniplugin` |
| **Antigravity** | `agy plugin install https://github.com/nagisanzenin/omniplugin` |
| **Hermes Agent** | `git clone https://github.com/nagisanzenin/omniplugin ~/omniplugin`, then add `~/omniplugin/skills` to `skills.external_dirs` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` — **clone, not the hub installer** (the skill Reads `docs/`, which referenced-files-only staging would sever — [rule R8](docs/02-portability-rules.md)) |
| **Anything else that reads `SKILL.md`** | clone the repo and point the platform at `skills/` — the whole repo must come along, because the skill routes into `docs/` |

Honest status, per the playbook's own rule: **none of these routes is verified live in this repo yet.** The Claude Code layout is the pattern engram ships and runs daily; the Codex manifests mirror engram's (which shipped without a live-binary check and degrade harmlessly); the Antigravity manifest is exactly the format its own schema and the engram PR #8 review established. The skill is plain markdown routing to plain markdown — the worst failure mode is a skill that doesn't register. Install it and tell me what you see; the doc upgrades when you do. Dogfooding receipts: the namespace-bleed check for the new root paths (`skills/`, `plugin.json`, `.agents/`) is [rule R9](docs/02-portability-rules.md) applied to this very repo, and version `0.1.0` moves in lockstep across both manifests per [04 · Maintenance](docs/04-maintenance.md).

## The case study in one table

engram v1.0.8, 2026-07-19 — what "one core, six platforms" concretely costs and buys:

| Platform | Glue that was needed | Rung |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | 2 JSON manifests (the conventions the core is written in) | L4 |
| OpenAI Codex | mirrored manifest + 3 TOML agent ports + install script | L2 (unverified against live binary; honest-status'd) |
| OpenCode | the one real adapter: TS self-extract + config bridge + deterministic updater (88 tests) | L4 |
| Hermes Agent | zero repo changes for skills (config entries) + one dual-mode hook variant | L3 (verified live, wire-level) |
| Antigravity | a 3-line manifest — discovery does the rest | L1, in review |
| OpenClaw | **zero new manifests** — it reads the Codex and Claude ones already there; one hook pack + one shared-doc page | L3 (skills, hook, and isolated-subagent grading verified live on 2026.7.1-2) |

Shared and byte-identical across all five: `skills/`, `agents/*.md` (as prompt source), `scripts/engram.py` (214 selftest checks, same count everywhere), one state dir.

## Scope, honestly

This is distilled from **one plugin shipping six platforms** (plus a researched survey of the rest of the landscape). It is a playbook, not a spec: platform loaders drift monthly, so every platform fact here is dated and versioned, and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) tells future maintainers how to keep it true. When this playbook and a platform's current docs disagree, the platform docs win — then fix the playbook.
